# P5.JS Sketchpad

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

## About

This is a P5.js sketchpad created in Angular based on [This article](https://indepth.dev/posts/1083/creating-a-sketchpad-with-angular-and-p5js)

Components use styling for the neon text from this [CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-neon-text-with-css/)

Implemented the P5JSInvoker abstract class from [here](https://github.com/soler1212/P5JSInvoker) in the Page Not Found component to see if this would be easier than the syntax used in the Home Page Component.

The Page Not Found component uses the WebGL renderer to create the sketch, this was something I did in processing a while back and translated to P5.js.
